# TrackU_smart_monitoring

## Project summary
• Aim at building a live tracking system for the garbage trucks with map routing by installing GPS in every truck. <br />
•	Provide map routing for the trucks to make it easy for the drivers as well as the owners to easily see the route along with installing checkpoints at different locations to ensure the vehicle is covering all the points needed. <br />
•	With the installation of GPS tracking devices onto all of their trucks, fleet managers are able to keep a watchful eye on their entire fleet of vehicles. <br />
•	They are able to see in real-time where each vehicle is located while it’s working. <br />
•	It will ensure vehicles and assets running safely and they can protect their assets from fire or damage by using sensors to determine safe vehicle conditions alerts.

## Working
Here in this IoT project, we will interface the GPS Module (Neo6M), Temperature and humidity sensor (DHT11), and Air quality sensor (MQ135) with NodeMCU ESP8266 and display the GPS data (Latitude, longitude), Temperature, humidity, and AQI on the website. By forwarding data on Firebase and further fetching data from Firebase for display on the web we can get the live data from our vehicle.
